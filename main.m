// Pet Wars <iPhone Programming Spring 2009 - Final Project>
//
// PetWars is an interactive iPhone app that allows you to raise your own pet into a killing machine! 
// With over a dozen ways to interact with the pet, you can train your pet into the ultimate fighter 
// and battle against your peers. Buy new toys or games at the store to keep your pet happy. Play some
// music from your phone’s music library and watch your pet react to the sounds. Keeping your pet healthy 
// and happy will be key to winning the peer to peer battles. There is also an online stat tracking system 
// which will tell you who has the healthiest pet, the happiest pet, and the strongest pet in the world.
//
// Enjoy the game’s unique graphics with its dynamically changing background that reflects real world time. 
// You can also enjoy the life-like physics when you’re dragging and throwing your pet around. Watch as your
// pet’s facial expression changes as it bumps into the walls. With so many ways to raise your pet, 
// you’ll never be bored with your iPhone ever again.
